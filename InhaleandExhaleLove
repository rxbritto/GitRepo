Hello everyone, have you wondered why people are rude to me? Be it an office or be it a family, people around us affect our happiness. Are you the one who thinks this way?. 
Just dissolve all those negative stuff and start affirming that "I'm being loved and lovable". 
Sometimes we end up screwing our mind with thoughts which is not even true. Oh, I'm being hated, no one likes me, now it's not them who ruined your positivity it's you. Nobody knows you more than you. Stop thinking what others think of you, enrich yourself with positivity. Spread love to haters, speak lovable words on them. You don't even need to directly talk to them. just affirm it yourself and see the amazing difference in people behavior. Inhale and exhale love. Stay happy and stay blessed :).
